    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>This almond berry crumb cake recipe is simple, sweet, and wonderful.</p>
    <p>The crumb cake itself is delicately fluffy, buttery, and moist, just like my Blueberry Buckle, and it would make an excellent base crumb cake recipe for variety of fruits and spices.</p>
    <p>I opted for an overload of fresh blueberries and raspberries. Every forkful of this crumb cake packs a juicy berry pop.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup slivered almonds, (1 1/4 ounces)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar, or</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup firm silken low-fat tofu</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract</li>
        <li>3 cups mixed berries, such as raspberries, blackberries and blueberries</li>
        <li>Confectioners' sugar, for dusting</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps for making preparing almond berry: </h4>

        <li>Place sugar(or Splenda), flour, salt and almonds in a food processor; process until finely ground. Add egg, tofu, butter and almond extract; process until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread berries evenly in the prepared gratin dish. Scrape the almond mixture over the top, spreading evenly.</li>
