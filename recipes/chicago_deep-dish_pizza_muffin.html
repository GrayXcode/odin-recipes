    <h1>Chicago deep-dish pizza muffin</h1>

    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>Home cooks will find deep-dish pizza, with its unique buttery cornmeal crust, more forgiving than its New York counterpart. No need to worry about having the hottest oven or too many toppings - just make sure your sauce is very thick and flavorful!
        I garnished mine with parsley and more Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient: </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>12 ounces pizza dough</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup canned tomatoes, broken up with a knife.</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning, for sprinkling.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 to 2 spicy italian sausage links.</li>
        <li>2 baby bella mushrooms, finely chopped.</li>
        <li>24 to 48 mini pepperoni slices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to prepare Chicago deep-dish pizza muffin.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Spray the cavities of a mini muffin pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza dough from the packaging and allow it to come to room temperature on a floured surface.</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin or your hands, roll it out into a VERY thin layer. Using either a small round cookie cutter (about 2 inches) or an empty 4.5-ounce can, cut it into rounds.</li>
        <li>Using your fingers, stretch the dough without tearing and press into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Next, assemble the pizzas. Spoon about 2 teaspoons of the crushed tomatoes into each cup. Sprinkle with a little Italian seasoning and top with about 1 tablespoon of mozzarella. Top with the mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni or whatever toppings
            you prefer.</li>
        <li>Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melty and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
