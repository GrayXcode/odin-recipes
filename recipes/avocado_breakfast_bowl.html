    <h3>Description.</h3>
    <p>Breakfast bowls are infinitely adaptable, which is why we love them. We use quinoa as a base, avocado and eggs for protein, and roasted sweet potatoes for bulk.</p>
    <p>For the eggs, you can soft or hard boil them. Soft-boiled eggs typically last up to 2 days in the fridge, so if you want to truly prep this whole meal ahead, hard-boiled eggs are a better option. Or, you can prep the sweet potatoes and quinoa ahead
        of time and then scramble or fry up an egg the morning of.</p>

    <h4>Steps to prepare Avocado Breakfast Bowl: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook quinoa: In a medium saucepan, combine quinoa and 2 cups water over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until water is mostly absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let quinoa cool
            5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, roast sweet potatoes: Preheat oven to 425º. On a large baking sheet, toss sweet potatoes and oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast until tender and golden, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Hard boil eggs: Place eggs in a small pot and cover by an inch of cold water. Place pot on stove and bring to a boil. Instantly turn off heat and cover pot. Let sit 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from pot and dunk into ice water. Peel, then halve lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Assemble bowls: Divide cooked quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes, hard-boiled egg, and chopped spinach and season with salt and pepper and everything bagel seasoning, if using.</li>
        <li>Before serving, top each bowl with ½ avocado and 2 tablespoons of your favorite cheese, if using.</li>
